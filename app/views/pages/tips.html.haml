    =title 'Tips'

    %p A few tips to help you make better use of the site.

    %h4 How We Organize the Info
    %p
      The heart of the site is
      %i Presentations.
      Presentations happen at
      %i Events.
      An event might be a conference, a debate, or an interview.
      When the presentation becomes available in a format you can watch or hear, that is a
      %i Publication.
    -#%p Maybe this is a little too verbose and distracting
    -#  Event types are:
    -#  %ul
    -#    - Conference::EVENT_TYPES.sort.each do |event_type|
    -#      %li= event_type
    %p
      The site provides tools aimed at helping you answer certain kinds of questions:
      %ul
        %li Where can I watch, hear, or read a specific presentation?
        %li Where did a specific presentation come from? How does it fit into timeline?
        %li What presentations have been given on a particular topic?
        %li What presentations are coming up?
        %li What events have I attended?
        %li What presentations have I already heard?
        %li Who has attended the same events I have attended?

    %h4 Searching
    %p
      Currently, search works with a single word or phrase, not a collection of keywords.
    %p
      Search recognizes certain words as "special"
      %ul
        %li A four-digit number will be treated as a year and match events and presentations from that year
        %li A country name will find events and presentations in that country (e.g. Norway)
        %li A two-character state abbreviation will find events and presentations in that state (e.g. GA)
        %li A city name will find events and presentations in that city
        %li presentations can also be found by a word from the presentation name or the speaker first or last name
    %p
      Clicking on a tag or entering a search term that is a tag (e.g.
      %span.tags_display.linked.slim economics
      ) will start a tag-based search.

    %h4 Event Types
    %p
      Events are categorized as
      = Conference::EVENT_TYPES.map{|e| e.pluralize}.to_sentence + '.'
      Events may have a physical location or be broadcast via the internet We call these internet events
      %i virtual
      events.
    %p
      Series events take place over an extended period, but without the structure of a conference.
      A series with virtual presentations (such as the
      = link_to 'Philosophy for Living On Earth', events_path('philosophy-for-living-on-earth')
      webinars) has no location.
      A series may have multiple locations (such as the
      = link_to "ARI Road to a Free Society", event_path('ari-road-to-a-free-society')
      series). In this case, each presentation has a separate date and city.

    %h4 Media
    %p
      Presentations have
      %i publications
      that indicate where you can find the talk. These are represented by icons:
    %ul
      - publication = Publication.new
      - Publication::FORMATS.sort.each do |format|
        - publication.format = format
        %li
          = link_to icon_for_format(publication).html_safe, '#', title: "Hovering over the icon will reveal supplemental info"
          = format
    %p
      Sometimes a talk will have multiple copies of the same icon. This usually happens when the talk is split into
      multiple parts. Hovering on the icon will reval the specific part.
