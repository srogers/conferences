      This site is a community supported archive of Objectivist conferences. The presentations are collected
      under each conference, with links to the material when it is available online. By bringing all this information
      together in one place, we hope it will be easier to find the many great presentations of the past that are lost
      in the infinity of the web.

      Our content depends on the resources of our contributors. Their memories and personal reference material are
      essential in piecing together a complete history. If you have any info that can expand our records, your
      contributions are welcome.
