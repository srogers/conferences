Greetings from the archive,

A presentation you're watching:

<%= link_to @presentation.name, presentation_path(@presentation) %>

has a new publication (<%= @publication.format %>)

You can see it here:  <%= link_to @publication.url, @publication.url %>

If you no longer wish to receive notifications for this presentation, you can turn them off on the presentation page.

Thanks,
The archive community
